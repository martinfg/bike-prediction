# # Exploration of Data of Nextbike-API

# %% [markdown]
# ### Observations / Assumptions
#
# - we can only see bikes which are free or reserved (booked) right now, we can't see bikes which are currently rented
# - available bikes includes the number of bikes which are reserved (booked)
# - the number of available bikes is 1349, this is the number we must get after preprocessing
# - we assume that there are two different kind of places:
#     - bike stations (spot=True and bike=False) where multiple bikes are assigned to one location
#     - individual bikes (spot=False and bike=True) where each bike has an own location
# - booked_bikes seems to mean the bikes that have been reserved in advance. So bikes_available_to_rent = bikes - booked_bikes
# - UIDs of bike stations seem to be in a different range than UIDs of bikes
#     
# ### Open questions
#
# - What is the mapping of the bike types? 71, 150, 183, 196? Maybe one of them code for e-bikes?? Is this relevant for our prediction?
# - At a station where there are multiple bikes and some of them are reserved (booked), can we find out which of them is reserved and which is free?
# - What are the different place types?
#
# ### Preprocessing
#
# - Keep all information from place-, city- and bike-list-section per bike
# - Maybe use [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to filter the data and build a JSON that can be easily read by pandas 
# - Parse name of place correctly (e.g. Stra√üe)
# - Filter out the reserved bikes?

# - It would be nice to have an additional attribute from type list which contains all related bike numbers.
# - Also it would be great to parse the strings correctly so that we can see the "Umlaute".
